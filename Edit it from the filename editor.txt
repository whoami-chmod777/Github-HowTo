Edit it from the filename editor

Did you know you can add and delete folders from the filename editor itself on GitHub? I didn't, but there's a nice blog post on the subject from 2013 here.

So, in my case, I could go into a file inside the folder in question, hit the button to edit the file, and then update the folder name using this method.

It's done!

Now I can clone my no-longer-weirdly-named folder onto my Windows PC with no issues! Yee haw!
